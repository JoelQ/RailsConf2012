# Keynote - DHH
## 9:00 AM session

### Progress
* It keeps me interested - DHH
* Everyone likes progress
* Non-controversial progress is not interesting to talk about

### Controversial progess

*How much do you really like progess*

* REST
* Ruby 1.9
* Bundler
* Rails 3
* Asset Pipeline
* Coffee Script - "I want my semi-colons!" - DHH

* "The old one was better!"

It is very easy to say you like progress when talking about it in the abstract
Progress that makes you unconfortable / Being open to change
Not all forward movement is progress, some addons just add drag

Objective/Subjective changes and progress

### Skepticism is ok
* Something is not necessarily better because it is new
* Default mode should be curious as opposed to suspicious

Two theories on why curious people change to suspicious

### Bad experiences
* A conservative is a liberal that got mugged
* Everyone likes the cutting edge until they cut themselves
* "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"!
* "We tried progres, it did't work"
* It makes sense but it is not a reasonable reaction

### Growing old
* Growing old
* Change is easy when you are young
* "Mr Mature" has something to lose with change
* A lot of investment in learning may be lost with new things
* Don't rock the boat too much, it's going in the right direction
* Young hippie -> Mr Mature takes ~ 30 years in real life
* In coding it takes 3-5 years before they become suspicious of progress
* Curious -> suspicious is pretty much a one way street

### Learning and newbies
* "Won't somebody please think of the newbies!?"
* Turning technology into *Easy Bake*
* Learning real skills requires taking risks
* There is no speed limit to learning
* Set high expectations, the system is designed so that everyone should keep up
* People volountarily let themselves be slowed down - think they are Mr Dummy

### Loss aversion
* People hate losing more than they like gaining
* Point of view greatly affects loss aversion
* Be willing to be a pioneer
* **Great products are made by people who use them**
* People personally care about projects that they use

### Progress is painful
* It is even more painful when you already know things because then you have to throw some things out
* Rails 4 will change things
* Rails 4 will break things

### Summary
* Stay young
* Stay curious
* Stay hippie ;)
