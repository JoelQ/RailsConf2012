# I18n on Rails: A Twitter approach
## Cameron Dutro
*10:30*

* Localization (L10n) is translating text
* Internationalization (I18n) is "everything else", plurals, dates, etc

### Default in rails
* I18n gem
* yaml and po files
* `t()` function
* slow, ruby only
* not web friendly (when was the last time you saw someone parsing yaml in javascript?"

## Twitter approach
* Translation center
* JSON format
* crowdsourced
* 550,000 volounteers

### Process
* import
* organize
* translate
* moderate
* export (into json)

* inline translation

### Context
* comments
* automated screenshots
* translations hints, context
* (abonne vs abbonements)

### Incentives
* building community
* reputation system
* badging - blue globe is in high demand
* moderator priveliges

### Alternatives to the i18n gem
* `fast_get_text`
* faster
* inline
* same json for ruby and javascript

* using moustache
* patching moustache to include internationalized

  <% = 
  _("Hello world);
  %>
  
  
* ruby, js, moustache, all connect to json
* i.e. `en.json`, `ka.json`

### Advantages
* Very scaleable
* Server-side rendering is efficient
* Translating in js is harder
* Compiler that bakes json directly into js

### Android and Iphone
* convertng json into xml
* UTF8 vs UTF16

## Doing this for my own application
*bringing these features to your own apps*


### Best practices
* **Budget enough time and resources!**
* integrate into the release process (code reviews, deployments)
* Culturaly neutral - use images and content that are relevant to various countries/cultures
* Think globaly
* Embed strings into your source code, inline
* Avoid text in images
* Leave room for other languages (65% rule, english space + 65%)
* Leave sentences intact
* Use unicode (UTF-8)
* Use appropriate fonts
* Keep your sentences simple
* Consider scaleiblity
* Use Ruby 1.9 (better support for unicode, etc..)


### Using this in ruby - CLDR gem
* Not that many great I18n libraries
* Twitter CLDR (common locale data repository) gem
* .localize function

    DateTime.now.localize(:es).to_s
    DateTime.now.localize(:hu).to_full_s
    1123.localize(:es).to_currency.to_s(currency: "EUR")
    
* getting info about a currency, e.g. symbol

* Pluralization
* Using :one, :few, :other
* Doing it inline with json-like syntax and interpolation
* Easier for translaters
* Coming to javacript soon

### Questions
* English text as keys, what happens if the programmer changes the key?
  * Automated tool with fancy logic to detect this

* Context into strings
  * Automated screen shots
  * inline translation
  * Overlaying the translation over the layout
  
* 65% rule for languages that are shorter than english?
  * Special CSS rules
  * Language code as a class
  * Language specific styles
  
* Does the gem include any extraction tools?
  * No
  * Ruby-parser is a good alternative
  * JS is much harder
  
* Deciding which languages get translated?
  * Need a community, size and vocal
  * Making it possible for a community to take charge
  
* Showing different images differently for various languages
  * Not really
  * Using generic images
  * Don't use text
  
* Rate of change for strings in twitter
  ~ 10 feature branches a day
  ~ 1-30 string changes each
  
* Process for removing translated strings
  * Using one file to store tranlations
  * Deactivating strings (for inline)
