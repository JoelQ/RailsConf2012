## Simplicity

*Simplicy is a requirement for reliability*

### Simple
* Single mindedness
* One role
* One task
* one concept
* one dimension
* not necessarily one instance (singleton)

### Easy
* "nearby"
* in our toolkit, IDE, gemset, apt get
* familiar
* near your capabilities
* easy is relative

### Limits
* We can only make things reliable that we understand
* We can only think of a couple things at a time
* Intertwined things must be considered together
* Complexity undermines understanding

### Change
* Do more, Do it differently, do it better
* Changes to software require analysis and decisions
* Ability to reason about a program is critical
* Simplicity isn't just defensive
* Simplicity = Opportunity
* Archetectural Agility wins out against all other types of agility
* Design is about pulling things apart
* Simple modular components are simple and easy and give us agility and ability to change

_Programmers know the benefits of everything and the tradeoffs of nothing_

* Don't be completely self-centered in your approach

### Programmers vs Programs
* We focus on ourselves
* Software quality
* Maintenance, change

### Making things easy
* get it approved
* become familiar
* learn new things
* take complex problems and move them towards a simple implementation
* we can create the same programs out of significantly simpler components
